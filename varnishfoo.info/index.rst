Varnish Foo
===========

.. _varnishfoo.pdf: https://varnishfoo.info/varnishfoo.pdf

Varnish Foo is the ultimate book on Varnish Cache. There's only one
problem: It's not done yet!

You can follow the development of the book through github:

https://github.com/KristianLyng/varnishfoo

or you can follow my blog, where I post new chapters as their draft
versions are done:

https://kly.no/

You can download a PDF of the last "release" here:

`varnishfoo.pdf`_

In time, you will also find pre-rendered HTML versions here. For now, use
the github link for that.
