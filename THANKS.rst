Contributors
============

Many have influenced this book, but a few have also done more than just
influence it. They are:

- Ronald Plöger, proof reading and solid feedback.
- Rubén Romero, provide license and generally advocating the work.


FIXME: The hope is that the above list will be bigger and more extensive.
The below text is true, but seems inappropriately huge compared to the
above list.


A few people who perhaps not contributed directly still deserve to be
mentioned. Most of these are people I worked with when I was working for
Varnish Software and was in charge of writing and developing the training
courses that they offer. The training material was eventually released as
"The Varnish Book" (not to be confused with this book).

- Per Buer, former CEO, current CTO of Varnish Software. We started Varnish
  Software with 2.5-4 people (depending on how you count). Per did all the
  heavy lifting and basically left me with complete freedom to do the
  things I felt needed doing. That included evolving the training material
  from a slide deck to what eventually became a book in its own right.
  Whenever a disagreement on content occurred, he always deferred to me.
  Without that freedom, I would not have gained the writing experience to
  confidently start this project.  Also, he's a generally nice guy, when he
  isn't `sneaking up on me`_.
- Varnish Software in general. I worked there from 2009/2010 to 2013 We
  were basically the definition of a startup, and it was very exciting and
  educational. A few shout outs goes to: Tollef Fog Heen, Martin Blix
  Grydeland, Yves Hwang, Dag Haavi Finstad, Lasse Karstensen, Rubén Romero.
- Magnus Hagander. Magnus is mostly known for his Postgresql-work, but has
  held numerous Varnish training courses, using material I provided.
  The feedback he gave allowed me to better develop the material, but more
  importantly, it gave me better understanding of how to write.
- Poul-Henning Kamp, principal developer of Varnish Cache. Couldn't really
  leave him out given how much I've learned from him over the years about
  anything not related to documentation. He has, however, never claimed
  that Varnish documentation is anything but bad, and has encouraged me
  over the years to write more about Varnish.
