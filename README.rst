Varnish Foo is the ultimate `Varnish Cache`_ book out there. Or it will be,
when it's done.

The book is being written by `Kristian Lyngstøl`_, a long-time Varnish
hacker. It is being published one chapter at a time, and you can either read it
online at `varnishfoo.info`_ or `download a PDF`_.

This book is not done yet. The individual chapters are meant to stand well
on their own, but many chapters are yet to be written and the content is
likely to evolve over time.

Found something that should be fixed?

I am very interested in any and all feedback, from pure spelling mistakes
to factual errors or whether the book flows well or not.

The best way to get in contact with me is to jump over to `the github
repo`_ and report an issue. If that doesn't work for you, you can also drop
me a mail at kly@kly.no.
