The "non-commercial" clause does explicitly not trigger on reading the

Printing it the book and giving it away to your customers or clients. Using

Building
--------

The goal is to produce a PDF that's nice and readable, but also material
that can be easily viewed on the web. Producing a pdf is simple, just run
``make`` on a system with ``rst2pdf`` installed.

Otherwise, the content should render OK directly on github.
