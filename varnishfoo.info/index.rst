About Varnish Foo
-----------------

Varnish Foo is the ultimate Varnish Cache book out there. Or it will be,
when it's done.

.. _Kristian Lyngstøl: https://kly.no/

The book is being written by `Kristian Lyngstøl`_, a long-time Varnish
hacker. It is being published one chapter at a time under a Creative
Commons non-commercial licence.

A very crude (format-wise) copy of the book can be found here, updated
periodically. The web-formatting will be cleaned up either when I find
time, or someone does it for me (HINT HINT).

A PDF version of the book is also provided, which is slightly prettier, but
still has some formatting issues (notably with page breaks at awkward
places).

A more updated version can always be found at the Github repository.

Found something that should be fixed?

I am very interested in any and all feedback, from pure spelling mistakes
to factual errors or whether the book flows well or not.

The best way to get in contact with me is to jump over to `the github
repo`_ and report an issue. If that doesn't work for you, you can also drop
me a mail at kristian@bohemians.org.
